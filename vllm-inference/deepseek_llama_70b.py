# # Launch DeepSeek-R1 on Your Own Cloud Account
#
# The Llama-70B distill of DeepSeek R1 is the most powerful and largest of the
# DeepSeek distills, but still easily fits on a single node of GPUs - even 8 x L4s with minor optimizations.
# Of course, inference speed will improve if you change to A100s or H100s on your cloud provider,
# but the L4s are cost-effective for experimentation or low throughput, latency-agnostic workloads, and also
# fairly available on spot meaning you can serve this model for as low as ~$4/hour. This is the full model,
# not a quantization of it.
#
# On benchmarks, this Llama70B distillation meets or exceeds the performance of GPT-4o-0513,
# Claude-3.5-Sonnet-1022, and o1-mini across most quantitative and coding tasks. Real world
# quality of output depends on your use case. This will run the model at ~20 tokens a second,
# which means it takes 1-5 minutes per question asked. It will take some time to download the model
# to the remote machine on the first run.
#
# We can easily add additional nodes, which will automatically form the compute. We will
# rely fully on vllm to make use of them and increasing tensor and pipeline parallelism.
#
# ## Defining the vLLM Inference Class
# We define a class that will hold the model and allow us to send prompts to it.
# This is regular, undecorated Python code, that implements methods to
# load the model (automatically downloading from HuggingFace), and to generate text from a prompt.

# ## Launch Compute and Run Inference
# Now we will define compute using Kubetorch and send our inference class to the remote compute.
# First, we define an image with torch and vllm and 8 x L4 with 1 node.
# Then, we send our inference class to the remote compute and instantiate a the remote inference class
# with the name `deepseek` which we can access by name later. Finally, we call the remote inference class
# as if it were local to generate text from a list of prompts and print the results. If you launch with multiple nodes
# you can take advantage of vllm's parallelism.

        Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules: If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.
        If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): IV and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM). Only powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5 (V), 50 (L), or 500 (D) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times use the subtractive form.
        Given an integer, write and return Python code to convert it to a Roman numeral.""",
